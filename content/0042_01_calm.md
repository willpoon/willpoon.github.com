Title: 按自己的步伐走

从年初开始，简历一直挂在网上。最近有两家公司找我，也算是知名大公司，待遇可以比目前提升50%以上。所以有点心动。

于是这几天都在忙于整理简历，打算试一试。结果影响了公众号的更新。除此之外，有些生活节奏也被打乱了。最重要的是，忘了自己的初衷，忘了自己想做什么，想要什么。

这不是好的迹象。为了待遇上的提升，我应该舍弃自己的追求、最初的梦想吗？

换工作后，可能：

1. 待遇提升，也还有时间继续追逐自己的理想。
2. 待遇提升，换方向，换地点，没时间继续自己的理想。会更累。

得到一些东西，必然也将失去一些东西。这就是平衡。

所以，我不应该有过多的期待。保持冷静，保持淡定，按自己的步伐走即可。


I put my CV on the internet on the beginning of this new year. 

And Recently , there are 2 companies find me by hunter. Both of them are famous. And the salary will be raised nearly 50%.

So I feel kinda attractive.

For that , these days I spend so much time on preparing my CV to apply the position they offer. As a result , this WeChat Pub Channel is Delayed updating.

Further more , my pace of life is disturbed. And the most impotant things is , It seems that I have forgotten my origin intention , forgotten my short-term goals , and fofrgotten my long-term goals.

That is not a good sign. Do I really want to give up my original dream and the things I persure , the girl I chase , the life I seek ?

If I change my job , maybe:

1. I get a salary upgrade , and I still have some time to develop myself. 
2. I get a salary upgrade , but I do not work on a position I like , and I have to change the workplace , and I don't have any time for myself. Also It's possible that the new job will exhaust me and make me feel more tired.

I found that when we get something , In the mean while , we lost something . that is so called : balance . 

so , I shall not have too much expectation . and I should keep calm , keep chillax , and walk at my own pace.
