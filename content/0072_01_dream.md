中午午休，才睡了10来分钟，就做了一个梦。

感叹睡眠效率之高的同时，我尝试回忆一下梦境的细节：

家人：赶紧找人结婚
我： 急什么
家人：别太挑
我：不是挑
家人：面子不能当饭吃，再漂亮也会老...
我：...
我：主要看感觉..................啊啊啊.....

(家人包括了我的父母、兄长)

梦里，我被逼得正发狂，然后就被离我半米远的同事的呼噜声嘈醒了。


朋友们，这个梦怎么解？

我到底是想结婚，还是不想结婚？ 现在连我自己也搞不清楚了。

this afternoon, I took a 10 minute's  nap and I had a dream.

To my suprise,I go so far to have a good sleep. And now I try to recall the details in my dream : 

family：find a girl and get married.
me: Don't worry about me.
family: Don't be too picky
me: Nothing to do with that.
family：Don't be too concerned about face-saving . Beautiful too, will grow old.
me: ...
me: I only care about the feeling ...

(the family members including my parents and my brother)

How to interpret this dream ， guys?

Now I don't even know If I want to get married or not ?!
